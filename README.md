# Image Generation in Javascript
Code samples from my Cologne.js talk on Image Generation in JavaScript using the Canvas API.

1. open index.html in a text editor of your choice
2. replace the included script at the bottom of the body element with any of the provided js files
3. open index.html in your browser (Chrome doesn't seem to like my Filter ImageData approach due to CORS issues - apparently works in Firefox, or in Chrome when running it in a local webserver environment instead of from the file system)
4. enjoy

Feel free to experiment with the codes however you like and use them for whatever you want.
In case of trouble, ideas, feedback or praise (the latter being preferred), you've got my permission to immediately reach out to me.

Cheers,
Markus
